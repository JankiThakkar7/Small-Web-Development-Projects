      Our solar system consists of our star, the Sun, and everything bound to it
      by gravity – the planets Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn,
      Uranus, and Neptune; dwarf planets such as Pluto; dozens of moons; and
      millions of asteroids, comets, and meteoroids.

            <p style="color: darkblue">
              The Sun is a 4.5 billion-year-old yellow dwarf star – a hot
              glowing ball of hydrogen and helium – at the center of our solar
              system. It's about 93 million miles (150 million kilometers) from
              Earth and it's our solar system's only star. Without the Sun's
              energy, life as we know it could not exist on our home planet.

            <p style="color: darkslateblue">
              Mercury is an extreme planet in several respects. Because of its
              nearness to the Sun—its average orbital distance is 58 million km
              (36 million miles)—it has the shortest year (a revolution period
              of 88 days) and receives the most intense solar radiation of all
              the planets.

            <p style="color: darkslategray">
              Venus is the second planet from the Sun and Earth's closest
              planetary neighbor. Even though Mercury is closer to the Sun,
              Venus is the hottest planet in our solar system. Its thick
              atmosphere is full of the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide, and it
              has clouds of sulfuric acid.

              Just slightly larger than nearby Venus, Earth is the biggest of
              the four planets closest to the Sun, all of which are made of rock
              and metal. Earth is the only planet in the Solar System whose
              English name does not come from Greek or Roman mythology. The name
              was taken from Old English and Germanic.

            <p style="color: deeppink;">
              Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun – a dusty, cold, desert
              world with a very thin atmosphere. Mars is also a dynamic planet
              with seasons, polar ice caps, canyons, extinct volcanoes, and
              evidence that it was even more active in the past.

                <p style="color: dodgerblue;">Jupiter is called a gas giant planet. Its atmosphere is made up of mostly hydrogen gas and helium gas, like the sun. The planet is covered in thick red, brown, yellow and white clouds. The clouds make the planet look like it has stripes.</p>

                <p style="color: lightcoral;">Saturn is the sixth planet from the Sun and the second-largest planet in our solar system. Like fellow gas giant Jupiter, Saturn is a massive ball made mostly of hydrogen and helium. Saturn is not the only planet to have rings, but none are as spectacular or as complex as Saturn's. Saturn also has dozens of moons.</p>

                <p style="color: forestgreen;">The seventh planet from the Sun with the third largest diameter in our solar system, Uranus is very cold and windy. The ice giant is surrounded by 13 faint rings and 27 small moons as it rotates at a nearly 90-degree angle from the plane of its orbit.</p>

                <p style="color: lightseagreen;">Neptune is one of two ice giants in the outer solar system (the other is Uranus). Most (80% or more) of the planet's mass is made up of a hot dense fluid of "icy" materials – water, methane, and ammonia – above a small, rocky core. Of the giant planets, Neptune is the densest.</p>

        <li>Asteroids, sometimes called minor planets, are rocky, airless remnants left over from the early formation of our solar system about 4.6 billion years ago.</li>
        <li>Comets are cosmic snowballs of frozen gases, rock, and dust that orbit the Sun. When frozen, they are the size of a small town. When a comet's orbit brings it close to the Sun, it heats up and spews dust and gases into a giant glowing head larger than most planets. The dust and gases form a tail that stretches away from the Sun for millions of miles. There are likely billions of comets orbiting our Sun in the Kuiper Belt and even more distant Oort Cloud.</li>
        <li>Meteoroids are objects in space that range in size from dust grains to small asteroids. Think of them as “space rocks."When meteoroids enter Earth’s atmosphere (or that of another planet, like Mars) at high speed and burn up, the fireballs or “shooting stars” are called meteors.</li>
